# Understanding System Design Through Mental Models

Complex systems become more manageable when viewed through the right lens. This article explores how mental models from various disciplines can improve our system design approach.

## The Power of Mental Models

Mental models are frameworks for understanding complex systems. We'll explore models from:

- Biology (evolutionary systems)
- Physics (entropy and organization)
- Economics (incentive structures)
- Psychology (cognitive load)

## Practical Applications

How these models translate to real-world system design:

- Designing for resilience
- Managing complexity
- Scaling considerations
- Evolution over time

## Case Studies

Real-world examples of mental models in action:

- How Amazon uses chaos engineering
- Netflix's microservices evolution
- Spotify's squad model
