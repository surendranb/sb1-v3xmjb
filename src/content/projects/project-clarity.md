# Project Clarity

Project Clarity transforms how teams create and maintain documentation. Built with a focus on developer experience, it automatically generates comprehensive documentation while maintaining a beautiful, searchable interface.

## The Challenge

Documentation often becomes outdated because it's treated as an afterthought. We needed a solution that would make documentation maintenance as natural as writing code.

## The Solution

Clarity integrates directly with your development workflow:

- Automatic documentation generation from code comments
- Real-time preview of documentation changes
- Built-in search with code snippet support
- Theme customization for brand consistency

## Impact

- Adopted by 50+ open source projects
- 40% reduction in documentation maintenance time
- 90% positive feedback from developer surveys
